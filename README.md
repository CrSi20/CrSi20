## HelloðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub account!

My name is Cristiana Silva. I am currently participating in a coding boot camp where I am learning about *Python* and *algorithms*, amongst others. I aim to learn coding skills, different coding languages, and algorithms. I am planning to start a career as a software engineer soon.

I am living in the UK, and I am originally from Braga, Portugal. Here you find a photograph of my small, but amazing city!
